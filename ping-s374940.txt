Task 4, part 2: Observed differences
The minimum RTT for oslomet.no and ox.ac.uk are relatively similar, though it is a bit surprising that the uk website is slightly faster.
ox.ac.uk was the fastest, followed closely by oslomet.no. This is not surprising since these two are in close proximity to where I ran the test.
The server for gaia.cs.umass.edu is for the University of Massachusetts, and the information would have to travel across the Atlantic and back.
Not surprisingly, the slowest was the one for Sydney, Australia.
